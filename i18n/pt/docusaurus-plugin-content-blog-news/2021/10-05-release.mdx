Many users faced issues with the September release, due to the bug in the installer.
However it was not a big issue and can be fixed easily, But there are people who are completely new to Linux in general.
So, this release belongs to them. This release fixes every issue on the previous release.

### Changelogs :
**`Bug Fix Release for v21.09`**
- Fixed `drivers getting removed via installer` bug (backlight, external monitor issues)
- Removed support for `flatpak` as it caused issue with thunar and plank (and other gtk applications)
- Removed support for `snaps` (Arch community really hated it)
- Replaced `lightdm` with **`sddm`**, as webkit2-greeter was causing issues on older machines
- Improved `openbox`, `bspwm`, `polybar` and other stuff
- And... I learned that I don't ~~need to~~ have to add everything people suggest
