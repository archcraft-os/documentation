# Improve Wiki

Follow this guide if you want to add documentation in Archcraft Wiki...

## Prerequisite

- You should have the basic understanding of the syntax of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). See [Docusaurus Markdown Features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

## Files and format

The **docs** directory has subdirectories (to categories documentations) which contains
the `.md` and `.mdx` files for each wiki post and a `_category_.json` file for docs category.

- Here's the example of `Boot Archcraft` section of our wiki
```
docs                          # Main Directory
└── boot-iso                  # Doc Category
   ├── _category_.json        # Category Properties
   ├── boot-with-usb.mdx      # Wiki Page
   └── boot-with-grub.mdx     # Another wiki page in same category
```
