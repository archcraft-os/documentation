# Setup System

Let's set up your system for local development...

- Install `nodejs`, `npm` and `yarn` on your system :
```bash
$ sudo pacman -S nodejs npm yarn
```

- Clone the `documentation` repository from Github :
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/archcraft-os/documentation
```

- Install required `node modules` in the root directory of the repository :
```bash
$ cd documentation
$ npm install
```

- Run the local development serverâ€‹ :
```bash
$ npm run start
```

- Add documentations, Edit pages, and when you're done, Build the website :
```bash
$ npm run build
```
:::note

Make sure the website should build successfully and you test the build on the local server before deploying it to Github (or creating a pull request).
