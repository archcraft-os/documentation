**Archcraft Prime : An Ultimate Exclusive Experience**
 
![gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/archcraft-os/misc-files/main/gifs/prime.gif)

## Introduction

**Archcraft Prime** offers every (`Not the one released after Prime`) exclusive stuff of Archcraft in ***One Single ISO***. It has [`Openbox Premium`](/docs/window-managers/stacking-wm/openbox), [`Bspwm Premium`](/docs/window-managers/tiling-wm/bspwm) and [`i3wm Premium`](/docs/window-managers/tiling-wm/i3wm) as well as all the exclusive wayland compositors ([`Sway`](/docs/wayland-compositors/sway), [`Wayfire`](/docs/wayland-compositors/wayfire), [`River`](/docs/wayland-compositors/river), [`Hyprland`](/docs/wayland-compositors/hyprland) and [`Newm`](/docs/wayland-compositors/newm)) pre-installed.

The flavor of Archcraft is a result of many people's requests and polls ([discord](https://discord.com/channels/888837929789710387/890046536778678355/1091409213147844658), [telegram](https://t.me/archcraftos/48993)) I did on communities. Based on the majority of voting in favor of the creation of this flavor, I present you the **`Archcraft Prime`**.

It's basically a **Bundle** that has everything Archcraft has to offer exclusively. The idea behind this is to provide everything for less and If users want everything, they don't need to get them separately, and have to install everything individually, Instead they can get the complete bundle and all they need to do is, Install the ISO (with the choice of their favorite WM or WC)

<!-- Compatibility -------------------------------- -->

## Compatibility

### Virtual Machines

This ISO works with VMs (Virtualbox, VMware, Qemu, etc). But **only the Window Managers** (X11) will work on it. All **the Wayland Compositors will not work**. If worked, They will be very laggy due to poor 3D support.

### Nvidia

There is no official support for Nvidia. Unfortunately, their drivers are so messy, and their products so random, that it’s impossible to help if `the wayland compositors on this ISO` don’t work on your machine. Every card seems to be random, and might work perfectly, or not work at all. However...<br/>
The `ISO` have everything configured **out-of-the-box**, Needed to run a _wayland compositor_ on **Nvidia**. It has all the needed modules enabled into `mkinitcpio.conf` and **initrd**, `Kernel parameters` are added, and the needed proprietary graphics drivers installed.<br/>
***Now, It's your choise to give it a try.***

**Update :** As Reported, Users are able to boot and Install the ISO on their Nvidia Machines.

**More info :** [Sway Installation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Sway#Installation), [Hyprland Nvidia](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Nvidia/), [wayland Requirements](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/wayland#Requirements), [DRM_kernel_mode_setting](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA#DRM_kernel_mode_setting), [NVIDIA#Installation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA#Installation)

### Intel Iris XE

Some users reported that, The Wayland Compositors on this ISO does not work on systems with `Intel Iris XE` GPUs.

**Update :** I've personally tested the ISO with an `Nvidia + Intel iris XE` system (***Dell Inspiron 5520***) and the ISO is working just fine.
