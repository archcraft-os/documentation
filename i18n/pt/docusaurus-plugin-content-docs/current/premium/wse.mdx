<!-- Compatibility -------------------------------- -->

## Compatibility

### Virtual Machines

This ISO does not work with **VMs (Virtualbox, VMware, Qemu, etc)**. I mean it does but... on some, you won't pass the login screen (SDDM) and on some, the compositors will be very laggy due to poor 3D support.

### Nvidia

There is no official support for Nvidia. Unfortunately, their drivers are so messy, and their products so random, that it’s impossible to help if the ISO don’t work on your machine. Every card seems to be random, and might work perfectly, or not work at all. However...<br/>
The `ISO` have everything configured **out-of-the-box**, Needed to run a _wayland compositor_ on **Nvidia**. It has all the needed modules enabled into `mkinitcpio.conf` and **initrd**, `Kernel parameters` are added, and the needed proprietary graphics drivers installed.<br/>
***Now, It's your choise to give it a try.***

**Update :** As Reported, Users are able to boot and Install the ISO on their Nvidia Machines.

**More info :** [Sway Installation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Sway#Installation), [Hyprland Nvidia](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Nvidia/), [wayland Requirements](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/wayland#Requirements), [DRM_kernel_mode_setting](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA#DRM_kernel_mode_setting), [NVIDIA#Installation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA#Installation)

### Intel Iris XE

Some users reported that, This ISO does not work on systems with `Intel Iris XE` GPUs.

**Update :** I've personally tested the ISO with an `Nvidia + Intel iris XE` system (***Dell Inspiron 5520***) and the ISO is working just fine.
