Xmonad is a tiling window manager for X. Windows are arranged automatically to tile the screen without gaps or overlap, maximizing screen use. Xmonad is written, configured and extensible in Haskell. Custom layout algorithms, key bindings and other extensions may be written by the user in configuration files. Layouts are applied dynamically, and different layouts may be used on each workspace. Xinerama is fully supported, allowing windows to be tiled on several physical screens.

:::

<!-- Configuration -------------------------------- -->

## Configuration

Xmonad is pre-configured in Archcraft. In this section, We'll see how the Xmonad window manager is configured, what tools and utilities are used to make it look and work like a complete desktop environment.

### Config Structure

The configuration structure of Xmonad in Archcraft looks something like this:

```
~/.config
└── xmonad          : Xmonad config directory
    ├── alacritty   : terminal config
    ├── scripts     : scripts used for Xmonad
    ├── themes      : all themes (polybar, rofi configs) 
    ├── dunstrc     : dunst config for notifications
    ├── picom.conf  : compositor config
    ├── xmonad.hs   : main Xmonad config file
    └── xsettingsd  : gtk themes, icons and fonts config file
```

### Terminal

**Alacritty** is the default terminal. In the Xmonad window manager, alacritty is launched with an alternative config file. If you need to change anything, make sure you modify the config files in `~/.config/xmonad/alacritty` directory. These are the following config files you can modify to change the behaviour of your terminal:

**`~/.config/xmonad/alacritty/alacritty.toml`** : Main configuration file <br/>
**`~/.config/xmonad/alacritty/colors.toml`** : Colors configurations <br/>
**`~/.config/xmonad/alacritty/fonts.toml`** : Fonts configurations

> If you need any help with alacritty config, run : `man 5 alacritty` in terminal.

:::warning

When you change the `theme`, the **colors.toml** and **fonts.toml** file get overwritten by the theme script.

> This is applicable only in <Highlight color="#c778dd">Xmonad Premium</Highlight> as themes are only available in it. On regular version, there's only one theme.

:::

### Notification

**Dunst** is used as a notification daemon for notifications in Xmonad. In the Xmonad window manager, dunst is launched with an alternative config file, which is `~/.config/xmonad/dunstrc`. So, If you need to modify anything, make sure you edit this file.

> If you need any help with dunst config, run : `man 5 dunst` in terminal.

:::warning

When you change the `theme`, the fonts and colors in **dunstrc** file get overwritten by the theme script.

> This is applicable only in <Highlight color="#c778dd">Xmonad Premium</Highlight> as themes are only available in it. On regular version, there's only one theme.

:::

### Wallpaper

**hsetroot** sets the wallpaper in the Xmonad. If you want to change the wallpaper, Edit the following scripts :

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="wm_1" label="Regular" default>

Edit `~/.config/xmonad/scripts/xmonad_autostart` script and add the path to your wallpaper.
```bash
# Restore wallpaper
hsetroot -cover '/path/to/your/wallpaper'
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="wm_2" label="Premium" default>

Edit `~/.config/xmonad/themes/wallpaper.sh` script and add the path to your wallpaper.
```bash
WALLPAPER='/path/to/your/wallpaper'
```
:::warning

When you change the `theme`, the script `wallpaper.sh` get overwritten by the theme script.

:::

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Statusbar

**Polybar** is used as the statusbar in Archcraft's Xmonad window manager.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="wm_1" label="Regular" default>

The configurations for polybar can be found inside the _theme_ directory directory of Xmonad `~/.config/xmonad/theme`

If you want to modify the **polybar** settings, or perhaps want to add/remove modules, then you need to edit the following files :

**`~/.config/xmonad/theme/polybar/config.ini`** : Main config file <br/>
**`~/.config/xmonad/theme/polybar/colors.ini`** : Colors config file <br/>
**`~/.config/xmonad/theme/polybar/modules.ini`** : Modules config file

> If you need any help with polybar config, visit : [polybar wiki](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="wm_2" label="Premium" default>

The configurations for polybar can be found inside the _currently applied theme's directory_, which is inside the _themes_ directory of Xmonad `~/.config/xmonad/themes`

Let's say that the currently applied theme is `default` and you want to modify the **polybar** settings, or perhaps want to add/remove modules, then you need to edit the following files :

**`~/.config/xmonad/themes/default/polybar/config.ini`** : Main config file <br/>
**`~/.config/xmonad/themes/default/polybar/colors.ini`** : Colors config file <br/>
**`~/.config/xmonad/themes/default/polybar/modules.ini`** : Modules config file

> If you need any help with polybar config, visit : [polybar wiki](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki)

:::warning

When you change the `theme`, the fonts in **config.ini** file and **colors.ini** file of polybar get overwritten by the theme script.

:::

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Launchers and Applets

**Rofi** is used for application launchers, command runner and various applets. To modify the rofi config, edit `~/.config/rofi/config.rasi` file.

> If you need any help with rofi config, run : `man rofi` in terminal.

The scripts for rofi that are used in Xmonad can be found it `~/.config/xmonad/scripts` directory. These are the following scripts that uses rofi to provide the launchers and applets in Xmonad :

**`rofi_askpass`** : rofi based `sudo` frontend to get root password <br/>
**`rofi_asroot`** : applet to open apps as root <br/>
**`rofi_bluetooth`** : bluetooth applet to quickly connect to BT devices <br/>
**`rofi_launcher`** : an application launcher, cmd runner, file manager and task manager  <br/>
**`rofi_music`** : music applet, that controls MPD with `mpc` <br/>
**`rofi_powermenu`** : power menu, with confirmation dialog <br/>
**`rofi_runner`** : quickly lets you run a command <br/>
**`rofi_screenshot`** : screenshot applet that works with maim <br/>
**`rofi_themes`** : applet to change the themes **`only in premium`** <br/>
**`rofi_windows`** : applet to manage open windows <br/>

If you want to modify any applet or perhaps want to extend the functionality of the applet, just edit these scripts above.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="wm_1" label="Regular" default>

The configuration of each script can be found inside the _theme_ directory of Xmonad `~/.config/xmonad/theme`

Let's say you want to modify the looks of **launcher**, then you need to edit the `~/.config/xmonad/theme/rofi/launcher.rasi` file. Same goes for every other applet, Edit the respective file in the same directory.

> If you need any help with rofi theming, run : `man rofi-theme` in terminal.

To change the colors and fonts of the launchers and applets, Edit the `~/.config/xmonad/theme/rofi/shared/colors.rasi` and `~/.config/xmonad/theme/rofi/shared/fonts.rasi` files.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="wm_2" label="Premium" default>

The configuration of each script can be found inside the _currenty applied theme's directory_, which is inside the themes directory of Xmonad `~/.config/xmonad/themes`

Let's say that the currently applied theme is `default` and you want to modify the looks of **launcher**, then you need to edit the `~/.config/xmonad/themes/default/rofi/launcher.rasi` file. Same goes for every other applet, Edit the respective file in the same directory.

> If you need any help with rofi theming, run : `man rofi-theme` in terminal.

To change the colors and fonts of the launchers and applets, Edit the `~/.config/xmonad/themes/<THEME>/rofi/shared/colors.rasi` and `~/.config/xmonad/themes/<THEME>/rofi/shared/fonts.rasi` files.

:::warning

When you change the `theme`, the **shared/colors.rasi** and **shared/fonts.rasi** files get overwritten by the theme script.

:::

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Compositor

**Picom** is used for compositing. It's a lightweight compositor with shadowing, advanced blurring and fading. In Xmonad, picom is launched with an alternative config file, which is `~/.config/xmonad/picom.conf`. 

If you need to change anything related to picom, Edit this picom config file.

> If you need any help with picom config, check the picom's default config file in `/etc/xdg/picom.conf`

:::info

If you're having screen-tearing issues, using `glx` backend can solve this issue. <br/>
If you're facing lagging, hangs and freezes, try switching between `xrender` and `glx` backend.  

:::

:::warning

When you change the `theme`, things like _backend_, _shadows_, _blurring_ in **picom.conf** file gets overwritten by theme script.

> This is applicable only in <Highlight color="#c778dd">Xmonad Premium</Highlight> as themes are only available in it. On regular version, there's only one theme.

:::

### Window Manager

The configuration of Xmonad is available in `~/.config/xmonad`. To configure Xmonad window manager, this is the main file that is used :

**`~/.config/xmonad/xmonad.hs`** : main xmonad config file with general settings, keybindings, layouts and window rules.<br/>

> If you need any help with xmonad configuration, visit : [Xmonad docs](https://xmonad.org/documentation.html)

:::warning

When you change the `theme`, things like _border colors_, _border width_, in **xmonad.hs** file gets overwritten by the theme script.
