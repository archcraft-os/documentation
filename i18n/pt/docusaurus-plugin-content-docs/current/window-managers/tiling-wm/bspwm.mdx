Bspwm is a popular tiling window manager. It represents windows as the leaves of a full binary tree. Bspwm supports multiple monitors and is configured and controlled through messages. It's an **alternate window manager** in Archcraft.

:::

<!-- Configuration -------------------------------- -->

## Configuration

Bspwm is pre-configured in Archcraft. In this section, We'll see how the Bspwm window manager is configured, what tools and utilities are used to make it look and work like a complete desktop environment.

### Config Structure

The configuration structure of Bspwm in Archcraft looks something like this:

```
~/.config
└── bspwm           : bspwm config directory
    ├── alacritty   : terminal config
    ├── scripts     : scripts used for bspwm
    ├── themes      : all themes (polybar, rofi configs) 
    ├── bspwmrc     : main bspwm config file
    ├── dunstrc     : dunst config for notifications
    ├── picom.conf  : compositor config
    ├── sxhkdrc     : keybindings config file
    └── xsettingsd  : gtk themes, icons and fonts config file
```

### Terminal

**Alacritty** is the default terminal. In the Bspwm window manager, alacritty is launched with an alternative config file. If you need to change anything, make sure you modify the config files in `~/.config/bspwm/alacritty` directory. These are the following config files you can modify to change the behaviour of your terminal:

**`~/.config/bspwm/alacritty/alacritty.toml`** : Main configuration file <br/>
**`~/.config/bspwm/alacritty/colors.toml`** : Colors configurations <br/>
**`~/.config/bspwm/alacritty/fonts.toml`** : Fonts configurations

> If you need any help with alacritty config, run : `man 5 alacritty` in terminal.

:::warning

When you change the `theme`, the **colors.toml** and **fonts.toml** file get overwritten by the theme script.

:::

### Notification

**Dunst** is used as a notification daemon for notifications in Bspwm. In the Bspwm window manager, dunst is launched with an alternative config file, which is `~/.config/bspwm/dunstrc`. So, If you need to modify anything, make sure you edit this file.

> If you need any help with dunst config, run : `man 5 dunst` in terminal.

:::warning

When you change the `theme`, the fonts and colors in **dunstrc** file get overwritten by the theme script.

:::

### Wallpaper

**Feh** sets the wallpaper in the Bspwm. If you want to change the wallpaper, Edit the script `~/.fehbg`

```bash
#!/bin/sh
feh --no-fehbg --bg-fill '/path/to/your/wallpaper' 
```
:::warning

When you change the `theme`, the script `~/.fehbg` get overwritten by the theme script.

:::

### Statusbar

**Polybar** is used as the statusbar in Archcraft's Bspwm window manager.

The configurations for polybar can be found inside the _currently applied theme's directory_, which is inside the _themes_ directory of Bspwm `~/.config/bspwm/themes`

Let's say that the currently applied theme is `default` and you want to modify the **polybar** settings, or perhaps want to add/remove modules, then you need to edit the following files :

**`~/.config/bspwm/themes/default/polybar/config.ini`** : Main config file <br/>
**`~/.config/bspwm/themes/default/polybar/colors.ini`** : Colors config file <br/>
**`~/.config/bspwm/themes/default/polybar/modules.ini`** : Modules config file

> If you need any help with polybar config, visit : [polybar wiki](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki)

:::warning

When you change the `theme`, the fonts in **config.ini** file and **colors.ini** file of polybar get overwritten by the theme script.

:::

### Launchers and Applets

**Rofi** is used for application launchers, command runner and various applets. To modify the rofi config, edit `~/.config/rofi/config.rasi` file.

> If you need any help with rofi config, run : `man rofi` in terminal.

The scripts for rofi that are used in Bspwm can be found it `~/.config/bspwm/scripts` directory. These are the following scripts that uses rofi to provide the launchers and applets in Bspwm :

**`rofi_askpass`** : rofi based `sudo` frontend to get root password <br/>
**`rofi_asroot`** : applet to open apps as root <br/>
**`rofi_bluetooth`** : bluetooth applet to quickly connect to BT devices <br/>
**`rofi_launcher`** : an application launcher, cmd runner, file manager and task manager  <br/>
**`rofi_music`** : music applet, that controls MPD with `mpc` <br/>
**`rofi_powermenu`** : power menu, with confirmation dialog <br/>
**`rofi_runner`** : quickly lets you run a command <br/>
**`rofi_screenshot`** : screenshot applet that works with maim <br/>
**`rofi_themes`** : applet to change the themes <br/>
**`rofi_windows`** : applet to manage opened windows <br/>

If you want to modify any applet or perhaps want to extend the functionality of the applet, just edit these scripts.

The configuration of each script can be found inside the _currenty applied theme's directory_, which is inside the themes directory of Bspwm `~/.config/bspwm/themes`

Let's say that the currently applied theme is `default` and you want to modify the looks of **launcher**, then you need to edit the `~/.config/bspwm/themes/default/rofi/launcher.rasi` file. Same goes for every other applet, Edit the respective file in the same directory.

> If you need any help with rofi theming, run : `man rofi-theme` in terminal.

To change the colors and fonts of the launchers and applets, Edit the `~/.config/bspwm/themes/<THEME>/rofi/shared/colors.rasi` and `~/.config/bspwm/themes/<THEME>/rofi/shared/fonts.rasi` files.

:::warning

When you change the `theme`, the **shared/colors.rasi** and **shared/fonts.rasi** files get overwritten by the theme script.

:::

### Compositor

**Picom** is used for compositing. It's a lightweight compositor with shadowing, advanced blurring and fading. In Bspwm, picom is launched with an alternative config file, which is `~/.config/bspwm/picom.conf`. 

If you need to change anything related to picom, Edit this picom config file.

> If you need any help with picom config, check the picom's default config file in `/etc/xdg/picom.conf`

:::info

If you're having screen-tearing issues, using `glx` backend can solve this issue. <br/>
If you're facing lagging, hangs and freezes, try switching between `xrender` and `glx` backend.  

:::

:::warning

When you change the `theme`, things like _backend_, _shadows_, _blurring_ in **picom.conf** file gets overwritten by theme script.

:::

### Window Manager

The configuration of Bspwm is available in `~/.config/bspwm`. To configure Bspwm window manager, these are the files that are used :

**`bspwmrc`** : main configuration file responsible for determining the behaviour and settings of the overall session. Edit this file to run your apps on startup, set window rules, configure workspaces, and bspwm appearance. <br/>
**`sxhkdrc`** : Bspwm does not handle any keyboard input and instead provides the `bspc` program as its interface. So, For keyboard shortcuts, a hotkey daemon `sxhkd` is used. Edit this file to add/remove keybindings. <br/>

> If you need any help with bspwm configuration, run : `man bspwm` in terminal. <br/>
> If you need any help with sxhkd configuration, run : `man sxhkd` in terminal.

:::warning

When you change the `theme`, things like _border colors_, _border width_, _gaps_ and _split ratio_ in **bspwmrc** file gets overwritten by the theme script.

:::

<!-- Keybindings ---------------------------------- -->
