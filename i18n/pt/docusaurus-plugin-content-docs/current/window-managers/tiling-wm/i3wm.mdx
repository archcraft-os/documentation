:::

<!-- Configuration -------------------------------- -->

## Configuration

i3wm is pre-configured in Archcraft. In this section, We'll see how the i3wm window manager is configured, what tools and utilities are used to make it look and work like a complete desktop environment.

### Config Structure

The configuration structure of i3wm in Archcraft looks something like this:

```
~/.config
└── i3              : i3wm config directory
    ├── alacritty   : terminal config
    ├── config.d    : modular i3wm config files
    ├── i3status    : i3status config files
    ├── scripts     : scripts used for i3wm
    ├── themes      : all themes (polybar, rofi configs) 
    ├── config      : main i3wm config file
    ├── dunstrc     : dunst config for notifications
    ├── picom.conf  : compositor config
    └── xsettingsd  : gtk themes, icons and fonts config file
```

### Terminal

**Alacritty** is the default terminal. In the i3wm window manager, alacritty is launched with an alternative config file. If you need to change anything, make sure you modify the config files in `~/.config/i3/alacritty` directory. These are the following config files you can modify to change the behaviour of your terminal:

**`~/.config/i3/alacritty/alacritty.toml`** : Main configuration file <br/>
**`~/.config/i3/alacritty/colors.toml`** : Colors configurations <br/>
**`~/.config/i3/alacritty/fonts.toml`** : Fonts configurations

> If you need any help with alacritty config, run : `man 5 alacritty` in terminal.

:::warning

When you change the `theme`, the **colors.toml** and **fonts.toml** file get overwritten by the theme script.

> This is applicable only in <Highlight color="#c778dd">i3wm Premium</Highlight> as themes are only available in it. On regular version, there's only one theme.

:::

### Notification

**Dunst** is used as a notification daemon for notifications in i3wm. In the i3wm window manager, dunst is launched with an alternative config file, which is `~/.config/i3/dunstrc`. So, If you need to modify anything, make sure you edit this file.

> If you need any help with dunst config, run : `man 5 dunst` in terminal.

:::warning

When you change the `theme`, the fonts and colors in **dunstrc** file get overwritten by the theme script.

> This is applicable only in <Highlight color="#c778dd">i3wm Premium</Highlight> as themes are only available in it. On regular version, there's only one theme.

:::

### Wallpaper

**hsetroot** sets the wallpaper in the i3wm. If you want to change the wallpaper, Edit the following scripts :

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="wm_1" label="Regular" default>

Edit `~/.config/i3/scripts/i3_autostart` script and add the path to your wallpaper.
```bash
# Restore wallpaper
hsetroot -cover '/path/to/your/wallpaper'
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="wm_2" label="Premium" default>

Edit `~/.config/i3/themes/wallpaper.sh` script and add the path to your wallpaper.
```bash
WALLPAPER='/path/to/your/wallpaper'
```
:::warning

When you change the `theme`, the script `wallpaper.sh` get overwritten by the theme script.

:::

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Statusbar

**Polybar** is used as the statusbar in Archcraft's i3wm window manager.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="wm_1" label="Regular" default>

The configurations for polybar can be found inside the _theme_ directory directory of i3wm `~/.config/i3/theme`

If you want to modify the **polybar** settings, or perhaps want to add/remove modules, then you need to edit the following files :

**`~/.config/i3/theme/polybar/config.ini`** : Main config file <br/>
**`~/.config/i3/theme/polybar/colors.ini`** : Colors config file <br/>
**`~/.config/i3/theme/polybar/modules.ini`** : Modules config file

> If you need any help with polybar config, visit : [polybar wiki](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="wm_2" label="Premium" default>

The configurations for polybar can be found inside the _currently applied theme's directory_, which is inside the _themes_ directory of i3wm `~/.config/i3/themes`

Let's say that the currently applied theme is `default` and you want to modify the **polybar** settings, or perhaps want to add/remove modules, then you need to edit the following files :

**`~/.config/i3/themes/default/polybar/config.ini`** : Main config file <br/>
**`~/.config/i3/themes/default/polybar/colors.ini`** : Colors config file <br/>
**`~/.config/i3/themes/default/polybar/modules.ini`** : Modules config file

> If you need any help with polybar config, visit : [polybar wiki](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki)

:::warning

When you change the `theme`, the fonts in **config.ini** file and **colors.ini** file of polybar get overwritten by the theme script.

:::

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Launchers and Applets

**Rofi** is used for application launchers, command runner and various applets. To modify the rofi config, edit `~/.config/rofi/config.rasi` file.

> If you need any help with rofi config, run : `man rofi` in terminal.

The scripts for rofi that are used in i3wm can be found it `~/.config/i3/scripts` directory. These are the following scripts that uses rofi to provide the launchers and applets in i3wm :

**`rofi_askpass`** : rofi based `sudo` frontend to get root password <br/>
**`rofi_asroot`** : applet to open apps as root <br/>
**`rofi_bluetooth`** : bluetooth applet to quickly connect to BT devices <br/>
**`rofi_launcher`** : an application launcher, cmd runner, file manager and task manager  <br/>
**`rofi_music`** : music applet, that controls MPD with `mpc` <br/>
**`rofi_powermenu`** : power menu, with confirmation dialog <br/>
**`rofi_runner`** : quickly lets you run a command <br/>
**`rofi_screenshot`** : screenshot applet that works with maim <br/>
**`rofi_themes`** : applet to change the themes **`only in premium`** <br/>
**`rofi_windows`** : applet to manage opened windows <br/>

If you want to modify any applet or perhaps want to extend the functionality of the applet, just edit these scripts above.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="wm_1" label="Regular" default>

The configuration of each script can be found inside the _theme_ directory of i3wm `~/.config/i3/theme`

Let's say you want to modify the looks of **launcher**, then you need to edit the `~/.config/i3/theme/rofi/launcher.rasi` file. Same goes for every other applet, Edit the respective file in the same directory.

> If you need any help with rofi theming, run : `man rofi-theme` in terminal.

To change the colors and fonts of the launchers and applets, Edit the `~/.config/i3/theme/rofi/shared/colors.rasi` and `~/.config/i3/theme/rofi/shared/fonts.rasi` files.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="wm_2" label="Premium" default>

The configuration of each script can be found inside the _currenty applied theme's directory_, which is inside the themes directory of i3wm `~/.config/i3/themes`

Let's say that the currently applied theme is `default` and you want to modify the looks of **launcher**, then you need to edit the `~/.config/i3/themes/default/rofi/launcher.rasi` file. Same goes for every other applet, Edit the respective file in the same directory.

> If you need any help with rofi theming, run : `man rofi-theme` in terminal.

To change the colors and fonts of the launchers and applets, Edit the `~/.config/i3/themes/<THEME>/rofi/shared/colors.rasi` and `~/.config/i3/themes/<THEME>/rofi/shared/fonts.rasi` files.

:::warning

When you change the `theme`, the **shared/colors.rasi** and **shared/fonts.rasi** files get overwritten by the theme script.

:::

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Compositor

**Picom** is used for compositing. It's a lightweight compositor with shadowing, advanced blurring and fading. In i3wm, picom is launched with an alternative config file, which is `~/.config/i3/picom.conf`. 

If you need to change anything related to picom, Edit this picom config file.

> If you need any help with picom config, check the picom's default config file in `/etc/xdg/picom.conf`

:::info

If you're having screen-tearing issues, using `glx` backend can solve this issue. <br/>
If you're facing lagging, hangs and freezes, try switching between `xrender` and `glx` backend.  

:::

:::warning

When you change the `theme`, things like _backend_, _shadows_, _blurring_ in **picom.conf** file gets overwritten by theme script.

> This is applicable only in <Highlight color="#c778dd">i3wm Premium</Highlight> as themes are only available in it. On regular version, there's only one theme.

:::

### Window Manager

The configuration of i3wm is available in `~/.config/i3`. To configure i3wm window manager, these are the files that are used :

**`~/.config/i3/config`** : main i3wm config file with general settings<br/>
**`~/.config/i3/config.d/01_theme.conf`** : theme config file, things like colors, border size, gaps<br/>
**`~/.config/i3/config.d/02_keybindings.conf`** : all the key bindings<br/>
