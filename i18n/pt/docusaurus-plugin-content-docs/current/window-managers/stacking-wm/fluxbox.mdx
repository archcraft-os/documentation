Fluxbox is a window manager for X11. It is based on the fluxbox 0.61.1 code, but with significant enhancements. Fluxbox provides a number of window management features such as tabbing and grouping. All Fluxbox configuration is stored in plaintext files; however, some settings are exposed graphically in the configuration menu.

<!-- Installation --------------------------------- -->

## Installation

Once you finish installing Archcraft, **Fluxbox** can be installed on the top of it. It's pre-configured and ready to go. Open a terminal and run the following command to install Fluxbox :
```bash
$ sudo pacman -Sy archcraft-fluxbox
```

<!-- Configuration -------------------------------- -->

## Configuration

Fluxbox is pre-configured in Archcraft. In this section, We'll see how the Fluxbox window manager is configured, what tools and utilities are used to make it look and work like a complete desktop environment.

### Config Structure

The configuration structure of Fluxbox in Archcraft looks something like this:

```
~/.fluxbox         : fluxbox config directory
├── alacritty      : terminal config
├── backgrounds    : wallpapers
├── scripts        : scripts used for fluxbox
├── styles         : fluxbox styles/themes
├── theme          : desktop theme (polybar, rofi configs) 
├── apps           : window configuration of specific apps
├── dunstrc        : dunst config for notifications
├── init           : main fluxbox configuration file
├── keys           : fluxbox keyboard shortcuts file
├── menu           : fluxbox menu config file
├── picom.conf     : compositor config
├── startup        : launch startup apps
├── windowmenu     : config file for altering the window menu
└── xsettingsd     : gtk themes, icons and fonts config file
```

### Terminal

**Alacritty** is the default terminal. In the Fluxbox window manager, alacritty is launched with an alternative config file. If you need to change anything, make sure you modify the config files in `~/.fluxbox/alacritty` directory. These are the following config files you can modify to change the behaviour of your terminal:

**`~/.fluxbox/alacritty/alacritty.toml`** : Main configuration file <br/>
**`~/.fluxbox/alacritty/colors.toml`** : Colors configurations <br/>
**`~/.fluxbox/alacritty/fonts.toml`** : Fonts configurations

> If you need any help with alacritty config, run : `man 5 alacritty` in terminal.

### Notification

**Dunst** is used as a notification daemon for notifications in Fluxbox. In the Fluxbox window manager, dunst is launched with an alternative config file, which is `~/.fluxbox/dunstrc`. So, If you need to modify anything, make sure you edit this file.

> If you need any help with dunst config, run : `man 5 dunst` in terminal.

### Wallpaper

**hsetroot** sets the wallpaper in the Fluxbox. If you want to change the wallpaper, Edit `~/.fluxbox/startup` script and add the path to your wallpaper :
```bash
# Restore wallpaper
hsetroot -cover '/path/to/your/wallpaper'
```

> To change the wallpaper quickly, Right click on desktop and go to `Fluxbox > Backgrounds`

### Statusbar

**Polybar** is used as the statusbar in Archcraft's Fluxbox window manager.

The configurations for polybar can be found inside the _theme_ directory directory of Fluxbox `~/.fluxbox/theme`

If you want to modify the **polybar** settings, or perhaps want to add/remove modules, then you need to edit the following files :

**`~/.fluxbox/theme/polybar/config.ini`** : Main config file <br/>
**`~/.fluxbox/theme/polybar/colors.ini`** : Colors config file <br/>
**`~/.fluxbox/theme/polybar/modules.ini`** : Modules config file

> If you need any help with polybar config, visit : [polybar wiki](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki)

:::tip

If you want to use the default Fluxbox toolbar instead of polybar, Edit `~/.fluxbox/init` file and enable it.
```ini
...
session.screen0.toolbar.visible: true
...
```

Also, edit `~/.fluxbox/startup` script and disable polybar on startup.
:::

### Launchers and Applets

**Rofi** is used for application launchers, command runner and various applets. To modify the rofi config, edit `~/.config/rofi/config.rasi` file.

> If you need any help with rofi config, run : `man rofi` in terminal.

The scripts for rofi that are used in Fluxbox can be found it `~/.fluxbox/scripts` directory. These are the following scripts that uses rofi to provide the launchers and applets in Fluxbox :

**`rofi_askpass`** : rofi based `sudo` frontend to get root password <br/>
**`rofi_asroot`** : applet to open apps as root <br/>
**`rofi_bluetooth`** : bluetooth applet to quickly connect to BT devices <br/>
**`rofi_launcher`** : an application launcher, cmd runner, file manager and task manager  <br/>
**`rofi_music`** : music applet, that controls MPD with `mpc` <br/>
**`rofi_powermenu`** : power menu, with confirmation dialog <br/>
**`rofi_runner`** : quickly lets you run a command <br/>
**`rofi_screenshot`** : screenshot applet that works with maim <br/>
**`rofi_status`** : applet to show various system informations <br/>
**`rofi_windows`** : applet to manage opened windows

If you want to modify any applet or perhaps want to extend the functionality of the applet, just edit these scripts above.

The configuration of each script can be found inside the _theme_ directory of Fluxbox `~/.fluxbox/theme`

Let's say you want to modify the looks of **launcher**, then you need to edit the `~/.fluxbox/theme/rofi/launcher.rasi` file. Same goes for every other applet, Edit the respective file in the same directory.

> If you need any help with rofi theming, run : `man rofi-theme` in terminal.

To change the colors and fonts of the launchers and applets, Edit the `~/.fluxbox/theme/rofi/shared/colors.rasi` and `~/.fluxbox/theme/rofi/shared/fonts.rasi` files.

### Compositor

**Picom** is used for compositing. It's a lightweight compositor with shadowing, advanced blurring and fading. In Fluxbox, picom is launched with an alternative config file, which is `~/.fluxbox/picom.conf`. 

If you need to change anything related to picom, Edit this picom config file.

> If you need any help with picom config, check the picom's default config file in `/etc/xdg/picom.conf`

:::info

If you're having screen-tearing issues, using `glx` backend can solve this issue. <br/>
If you're facing lagging, hangs and freezes, try switching between `xrender` and `glx` backend.  

:::

### Window Manager

The configuration of Fluxbox is available in your home directory. To configure Fluxbox window manager, these are the files that are used :

**`apps`** : a configuration file for remembering the window configuration of specific apps <br/>
**`init`** : the main fluxbox resource configuration file <br/>
**`keys`** : the fluxbox keyboard shortcuts (hotkeys) file <br/>
**`menu`** : the fluxbox menu config <br/>
**`startup`** : where to launch startup apps <br/>
**`windowmenu`** : a configuration file for altering the Window Menu itself

> If you need any help with fluxbox configuration, See the manpages. Also visit [Fluxbox Wiki](https://fluxboxwiki.github.io/)

<summary><b>Why Alacritty is not working on my computer?</b></summary>

Since Alacritty is a OpenGL based terminal emulator, It may not work on some computer hardwares. You can make it work on such computers by following these methods :

1. Open alacritty with **LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1** variable. Edit the keybindings/script launching alacritty and replace `alacritty` with `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 alacritty`
2. Edit **/usr/share/applications/Alacritty.desktop** desktop file and replace `Exec=alacritty` with `Exec=env LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 alacritty`
