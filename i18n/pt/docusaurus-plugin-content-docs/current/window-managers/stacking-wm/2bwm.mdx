<!-- Theme ---------------------------------------- -->
<!-- Tabs -->
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

<!-- Add your stuff after this -------------------- -->

2bwm is a fast floating WM, with the particularity of having 2 borders, written over the XCB library and derived from mcwm written by Michael Cardell. In 2bwm everything is accessible from the keyboard but a pointing device can be used for move, resize and raise/lower.

<!-- Installation --------------------------------- -->

## Installation

Once you finish installing Archcraft, **2bwm** can be installed on the top of it. It's pre-configured and ready to go. Open a terminal and run the following command to install 2bwm :
```bash
$ sudo pacman -Sy archcraft-2bwm
```

<!-- Configuration -------------------------------- -->

## Configuration

2bwm is pre-configured in Archcraft. In this section, We'll see how the 2bwm window manager is configured, what tools and utilities are used to make it look and work like a complete desktop environment.

### Config Structure

The configuration structure of 2bwm in Archcraft looks something like this:

```
/opt
└── 2bwm-source               : 2bwm source code
    └── config.h              : 2bwm config file
/usr
└── share
    └── archcraft
        └── 2bwm
            ├── alacritty     : terminal config
            ├── scripts       : scripts used for 2bwm
            ├── theme         : desktop theme (polybar, rofi configs) 
            ├── dunstrc       : dunst config for notifications
            ├── picom.conf    : compositor config
            └── xsettingsd    : gtk themes, icons and fonts config file
```

### Terminal

**Alacritty** is the default terminal. In 2bwm window manager, alacritty is launched with an alternative config file. If you need to change anything, make sure you modify the config files in `/usr/share/archcraft/2bwm/alacritty` directory. These are the following config files you can modify to change the behaviour of your terminal:

**`/usr/share/archcraft/2bwm/alacritty/alacritty.toml`** : Main configuration file <br/>
**`/usr/share/archcraft/2bwm/alacritty/colors.toml`** : Colors configurations <br/>
**`/usr/share/archcraft/2bwm/alacritty/fonts.toml`** : Fonts configurations

> If you need any help with alacritty config, run : `man 5 alacritty` in terminal.

### Notification

**Dunst** is used as a notification daemon for notifications in 2bwm. In 2bwm window manager, dunst is launched with an alternative config file, which is `/usr/share/archcraft/2bwm/dunstrc`. So, If you need to modify anything, make sure you edit this file.

> If you need any help with dunst config, run : `man 5 dunst` in terminal.

### Wallpaper

**hsetroot** sets the wallpaper in the 2bwm. If you want to change the wallpaper, Edit `/usr/share/archcraft/2bwm/scripts/2bwm_autostart` script and add the path to your wallpaper :
```bash
# Restore wallpaper
hsetroot -cover '/path/to/your/wallpaper'
```

### Statusbar

**Polybar** is used as the statusbar in Archcraft's 2bwm window manager.

The configurations for polybar can be found inside the _theme_ directory directory of 2bwm `/usr/share/archcraft/2bwm/theme`

If you want to modify the **polybar** settings, or perhaps want to add/remove modules, then you need to edit the following files :

**`/usr/share/archcraft/2bwm/theme/polybar/config.ini`** : Main config file <br/>
**`/usr/share/archcraft/2bwm/theme/polybar/colors.ini`** : Colors config file <br/>
**`/usr/share/archcraft/2bwm/theme/polybar/modules.ini`** : Modules config file

> If you need any help with polybar config, visit : [polybar wiki](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki)

### Launchers and Applets

**Rofi** is used for application launchers, command runner and various applets. To modify the rofi config, edit `~/.config/rofi/config.rasi` file.

> If you need any help with rofi config, run : `man rofi` in terminal.

The scripts for rofi that are used in 2bwm can be found it `/usr/share/archcraft/2bwm/scripts` directory. These are the following scripts that uses rofi to provide the launchers and applets :

**`rofi_askpass`** : rofi based `sudo` frontend to get root password <br/>
**`rofi_asroot`** : applet to open apps as root <br/>
**`rofi_bluetooth`** : bluetooth applet to quickly connect to BT devices <br/>
**`rofi_launcher`** : an application launcher, cmd runner, file manager and task manager  <br/>
**`rofi_music`** : music applet, that controls MPD with `mpc` <br/>
**`rofi_powermenu`** : power menu, with confirmation dialog <br/>
**`rofi_runner`** : quickly lets you run a command <br/>
**`rofi_screenshot`** : screenshot applet that works with maim <br/>

If you want to modify any applet or perhaps want to extend the functionality of the applet, just edit these scripts above.

The configuration of each script can be found inside the _theme_ directory of 2bwm `/usr/share/archcraft/2bwm/theme`

Let's say you want to modify the looks of **launcher**, then you need to edit the `/usr/share/archcraft/2bwm/theme/rofi/launcher.rasi` file. Same goes for every other applet, Edit the respective file in the same directory.

> If you need any help with rofi theming, run : `man rofi-theme` in terminal.

To change the colors and fonts of the launchers and applets, Edit the `/usr/share/archcraft/2bwm/theme/rofi/shared/colors.rasi` and `/usr/share/archcraft/2bwm/theme/rofi/shared/fonts.rasi` files.

### Compositor

**Picom** is used for compositing. It's a lightweight compositor with shadowing, advanced blurring and fading. In 2bwm, picom is launched with an alternative config file, which is `/usr/share/archcraft/2bwm/picom.conf`. 

If you need to change anything related to picom, Edit this picom config file.

> If you need any help with picom config, check the picom's default config file in `/etc/xdg/picom.conf`

:::info

If you're having screen-tearing issues, using `glx` backend can solve this issue. <br/>
If you're facing lagging, hangs and freezes, try switching between `xrender` and `glx` backend.  

:::

### Window Manager

`/opt/2bwm-source/config.h` is the main configuration file of 2bwm. If you need to change anything or perhaps you want to add/remove/change keybindings, Edit this file and recompile 2bwm and then install the new binary.

> If you need any help with 2bwm configuration and customisation, run : `man 2bwm`

<!-- Keybindings ---------------------------------- -->

<summary><b>Why Alacritty is not working on my computer?</b></summary>

Since Alacritty is a OpenGL based terminal emulator, It may not work on some computer hardwares. You can make it work on such computers by following these methods :

1. Open alacritty with **LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1** variable. Edit the keybindings/script launching alacritty and replace `alacritty` with `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 alacritty`
2. Edit **/usr/share/applications/Alacritty.desktop** desktop file and replace `Exec=alacritty` with `Exec=env LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 alacritty`
