# Blackbox

<!-- Theme ---------------------------------------- -->
<!-- Tabs -->
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<!-- Badges -->
export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '4px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0 0.2rem 0 0.2rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<!-- Add your stuff after this -------------------- -->

Fast, lightweight window manager for X, without all those annoying library dependencies. Blackbox is built with C++ and contains completely original code (even though the graphics implementation is similar to that of WindowMaker).

<!-- Installation --------------------------------- -->

## Installation

Once you finish installing Archcraft, **Blackbox** can be installed on the top of it. It's pre-configured and ready to go. Open a terminal and run the following command to install Blackbox :
```bash
$ sudo pacman -Sy archcraft-blackbox
```

<!-- Configuration -------------------------------- -->

## Configuration

Blackbox is pre-configured in Archcraft. In this section, We'll see how the Blackbox window manager is configured, what tools and utilities are used to make it look and work like a complete desktop environment.

### Config Structure

The configuration structure of Blackbox in Archcraft looks something like this:

```
/usr/bin/run-blackbox   : Autostart programs
~/.blackboxrc           : main blackbox config file
~/.blackbox             : blackbox config directory
├── alacritty           : terminal config
├── scripts             : scripts used for blackbox
├── styles              : blackbox styles/themes
├── theme               : desktop theme (polybar, rofi configs) 
├── dunstrc             : dunst config for notifications
├── menu                : blackbox menu config
├── picom.conf          : compositor config
├── sxhkdrc             : keybindings config
└── xsettingsd          : gtk themes, icons and fonts config file
```

### Terminal

**Alacritty** is the default terminal. In the Blackbox window manager, alacritty is launched with an alternative config file. If you need to change anything, make sure you modify the config files in `~/.blackbox/alacritty` directory. These are the following config files you can modify to change the behaviour of your terminal:

**`~/.blackbox/alacritty/alacritty.toml`** : Main configuration file <br/>
**`~/.blackbox/alacritty/colors.toml`** : Colors configurations <br/>
**`~/.blackbox/alacritty/fonts.toml`** : Fonts configurations

> If you need any help with alacritty config, run : `man 5 alacritty` in terminal.

### Notification

**Dunst** is used as a notification daemon for notifications in Blackbox. In the Blackbox window manager, dunst is launched with an alternative config file, which is `~/.blackbox/dunstrc`. So, If you need to modify anything, make sure you edit this file.

> If you need any help with dunst config, run : `man 5 dunst` in terminal.

### Wallpaper

**hsetroot** sets the wallpaper in the Blackbox. If you want to change the wallpaper, Edit `/usr/bin/run-blackbox` script and add the path to your wallpaper :
```bash
# Restore wallpaper
hsetroot -cover '/path/to/your/wallpaper'
```

### Statusbar

**Polybar** is used as the statusbar in Archcraft's Blackbox window manager.

The configurations for polybar can be found inside the _theme_ directory directory of Blackbox `~/.blackbox/theme`

If you want to modify the **polybar** settings, or perhaps want to add/remove modules, then you need to edit the following files :

**`~/.blackbox/theme/polybar/config.ini`** : Main config file <br/>
**`~/.blackbox/theme/polybar/colors.ini`** : Colors config file <br/>
**`~/.blackbox/theme/polybar/modules.ini`** : Modules config file

> If you need any help with polybar config, visit : [polybar wiki](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki)

### Launchers and Applets

**Rofi** is used for application launchers, command runner and various applets. To modify the rofi config, edit `~/.config/rofi/config.rasi` file.

> If you need any help with rofi config, run : `man rofi` in terminal.

The scripts for rofi that are used in Blackbox can be found it `~/.blackbox/scripts` directory. These are the following scripts that uses rofi to provide the launchers and applets in Blackbox :

**`rofi_askpass`** : rofi based `sudo` frontend to get root password <br/>
**`rofi_asroot`** : applet to open apps as root <br/>
**`rofi_bluetooth`** : bluetooth applet to quickly connect to BT devices <br/>
**`rofi_launcher`** : an application launcher, cmd runner, file manager and task manager  <br/>
**`rofi_music`** : music applet, that controls MPD with `mpc` <br/>
**`rofi_powermenu`** : power menu, with confirmation dialog <br/>
**`rofi_runner`** : quickly lets you run a command <br/>
**`rofi_screenshot`** : screenshot applet that works with maim <br/>

If you want to modify any applet or perhaps want to extend the functionality of the applet, just edit these scripts above.

The configuration of each script can be found inside the _theme_ directory of Blackbox `~/.blackbox/theme`

Let's say you want to modify the looks of **launcher**, then you need to edit the `~/.blackbox/theme/rofi/launcher.rasi` file. Same goes for every other applet, Edit the respective file in the same directory.

> If you need any help with rofi theming, run : `man rofi-theme` in terminal.

To change the colors and fonts of the launchers and applets, Edit the `~/.blackbox/theme/rofi/shared/colors.rasi` and `~/.blackbox/theme/rofi/shared/fonts.rasi` files.

### Compositor

**Picom** is used for compositing. It's a lightweight compositor with shadowing, advanced blurring and fading. In Blackbox, picom is launched with an alternative config file, which is `~/.blackbox/picom.conf`. 

If you need to change anything related to picom, Edit this picom config file.

> If you need any help with picom config, check the picom's default config file in `/etc/xdg/picom.conf`

:::info

If you're having screen-tearing issues, using `glx` backend can solve this issue. <br/>
If you're facing lagging, hangs and freezes, try switching between `xrender` and `glx` backend.  

:::

### Window Manager

The configuration of Blackbox is available in your home directory. To configure Blackbox window manager, these are the files that are used :

**`~/.blackboxrc`** : main configuration file responsible for determining the behaviour and settings of the overall session. Edit this file to configure slit, toolbar, workspaces, menu and blackbox appearance. <br/>
**`~/.blackbox/sxhkdrc`** : keyboard shortcuts, Edit this file to add/remove keybindings. <br/>
**`~/.blackbox/menu`** : Right click menu, Edit this file to add/remove menu items.

> If you need any help with blackbox configuration, run : `man blackbox` in terminal. <br/>
> If you need any help with sxhkd configuration, run : `man sxhkd` in terminal.
