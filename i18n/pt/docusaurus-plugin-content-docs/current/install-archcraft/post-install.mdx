# Post Installation

After installing Archcraft, there are few things you should do...

### Update System
Refresh package database and Update your new installation.
```bash
$ sudo pacman -Syyu
```

If you get `invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)` error, do...

```bash
$ sudo pacman -S archlinux-keyring
$ sudo pacman-key --init
$ sudo pacman-key --populate
```

### Install New Softwares
Install your favorite programs with pacman or yay (AUR).

```bash
$ sudo pacman -S gimp inkscape

# Or from AUR

$ yay -S spotify		
```

### Fix Screen Tearing
If you're facing screen tearing issue then :

1. Enable `GLX` backend for compositor. If you're using `openbox` then right click on the desktop and 
go to **Preferences > Compositor** and click on `Use 'glx' backend` or you can edit `~/.config/picom.conf` file manually.

1. If first option does not work for you, Create a `xorg.conf` file like this :

```bash
# Change to xorg.conf.d dir
$ cd /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d

# Create a conf file
$ sudo touch 20-amdgpu.conf

# Edit the file
$ sudo vim 20-amdgpu.conf

# Paste this in the editor
Section "Device"
     Identifier "AMD"
     Driver "amdgpu"
     Option "TearFree" "true"
EndSection						
```
:::danger

This method may not work on your system and you might not be able to boot into **xorg**. So make sure you know how to use **tty** or boot into **recovery mode** to revert the changes you made.

:::

### Enable Suspend Service
Enable betterlockscreen's suspend service for your user account.

```bash
# Enable betterlockscreen suspend service

$ sudo systemctl enable betterlockscreen@$USER.service						
```

### Fix Lock Screen Background
Fix lock screen layout on hidpi or low resolution displays.

```bash
# Update the lockscreen wallpaper

$ betterlockscreen -u /usr/share/backgrounds/groot.jpg
```

Well, that's pretty much everything for now, go ahead and enjoy Archcraft.
