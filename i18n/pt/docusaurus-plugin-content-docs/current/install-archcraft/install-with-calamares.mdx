# Install Archcraft With Calamares

This is a simple guide for beginners and linux newbies to install Archcraft on their system, without messing it up.
In this guide, I'll be installing Archcraft on an UEFI system. But the process is the same if you are using Legacy BIOS.
Follow the steps below to install Archcraft.

I'm assuming that you have already created a [bootable USB](../boot-iso/boot-with-usb) with Archcraft ISO, boot system with it and
select **Boot Archcraft**. Launch the installer via either welcome app or menu.

### Preparation

On the welcome screen, Select the installer language and click on <kbd>Next</kbd>

Select your **Region**, **Time Zone**, **System Locale** etc and click on <kbd>Next</kbd> `If you're connected to the internet, this will be adjusted automatically`

Select your **Keyboard Layout** and click on <kbd>Next</kbd> `By default, the keyboard layout is automatically adjusted according to selected system locale`

### Partitioning

:::note

**In this guide, All partitioning operations are performed on an empty disk.**

:::

Here comes the **scary** part where almost every Linux newbie messes things up.
So, Be careful what you do here. It is recommended that you read and understand [Partition scheme](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Partitioning#Partition_scheme)
before doing any partitioning on your system.

If you're installing Archcraft on Virtualbox (*on a newly created virtual machine*), You can just select `Erase disk`
But on real machine, that's not a great idea (*unless you decided to wipe your system completely*)
On real hardware, It's better you choose `Manual Partitioning` and in this guide, we're going to do the same.
Click on that radio button and click on <kbd>Next</kbd>

Here, You can see that the disk is completely empty (*But in your case you may see a bunch of partitions here*).
Let's create a **Partition table** first. For UEFI, use `GPT` partition table and for BIOS, use `MBR`.

> *You don't need to create a partition table if your disk has partitions already, It's only for empty disks*.

Partition table is created and you can see the `Free Space` on your disk. Now, Click on <kbd>Create</kbd> button to create partitions.

For this installation, We are going to create three partition :
- `boot` : /boot/efi
- `root` : /
- `home` : /home

Additionally, you can (*You Should*) also setup a separate **swap** partition, I'm skipping that here.

On **UEFI systems**, a separate partition is needed to boot the system. If you're on BIOS, You can skip creating a separate `boot` partition.

:::danger

Your system may already have an **EFI** partition. In that case **`DO NOT FORMAT IT`** or you won't be able to boot into other installed OS (Let's say windows)<br/>
Just mount the EFI partition to `/boot/efi` 

:::

:::caution

Make sure your EFI partition has at least `100MB of free storage`, or the installation will fail.

:::

Since in our case, the disk is empty, Let's make an EFI partition. As you can see, I've created a `300MB` partition with **fat32** file system
and mounted it to `/boot/efi` and set the **boot** flag.

Now create a `root` partition. Again, Select `Free Space` and Click on <kbd>Create</kbd>.
Select the size of your root partition (*make sure it's at least 10GB in size*), file system (*If you don't care, go with **ext4** fs*).
Mount it to `/` and set the flag to **root**, Optionally you can also set the **label** for the file system and if you want to use **Encryption**, Check the `Encrypt` box and set up a password.

And at last, create a `home` partition and mount that to `/home`.

![img](./calamares/9.png)

Here's how our partitions look for this installation. When you sure everything is okay, Click on <kbd>Next</kbd>

### Finalization

Create a `user account` for you, this is a simple form, fill it up and click on <kbd>Next</kbd>

![img](./calamares/11.png)

Here's the summary for this installation, Whatever changes you have made and what the installer is going to do now.
Have a look at that and when you're satisfied, click on <kbd>Next</kbd> to being the **`Installation`**

![img](./calamares/12.png)

Now, The actual installation begins, It'll take a few minutes so in the meantime you can stare at the slides or...
I don't know, go get a coffee or something.

When it's done, Check that `Reboot now` box to reboot the system instantly.

**Well, Thatâ€™s it! Archcraft is installed on your system. Enjoy!**
