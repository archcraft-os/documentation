**New Flavor (Lite) of Archcraft is now available to download.**

Archcraft Lite is another flavor of Archcraft, targeted at intermediate/power Linux users.

## Verify the authenticity of the ISO

- Download the **`ISO`**, **`gpg signature`** and **`sha256sum`** files
- Make sure all the files are present in the same directory (Assuming `~/Downloads`)
- First, Verify the details of the key on keyserver, Open a terminal and run (any one):
```
$ gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 7DC81F73
$ gpg --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 7DC81F73
$ gpg --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 7DC81F73
```

- Then, Open `terminal` in the `~/Downloads` folder and run following command :
```
$ gpg --verify archcraft-lite-2021.11.13-x86_64.iso.sig
```

- Finally, Verify the `sha256sum` by running :
```
$ sha256sum -c archcraft-lite-2021.11.13-x86_64.iso.sha256sum
```
