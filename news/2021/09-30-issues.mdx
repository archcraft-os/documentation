## Summery

Due to a <Highlight color="#E06B74">bug</Highlight> in installer scripts, users are facing few issues on September ISO.
Support for <Highlight color="#55B6C2">flatpak</Highlight> caused issues with gtk applications such as **thunar** and **plank**.

<!--truncate-->

## Issues
1. Unable to adjust display brightness
1. Launching Thunar and plank takes a long time
1. Lightdm greeter crashes / lags / shows error

## Solutions

You can try these methods to fix issues with the new ISO.

### Install drivers

Use `lspci` to get the information about available graphics card(s) on your system, and install the appropriate drivers.
```bash
$ lspci -k | grep -P 'VGA|3D|Display'
03:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Picasso (rev c2)
```
In that case, Install `xf86-video-amdgpu` package and reboot the system.

### Remove Flatpak

Remove `flatpak` package to resolve the issue with gtk applications.
```bash
$ sudo pacman -Rnscv flatpak
```

:::caution
This operation will also remove `pamac-all` as flatpak is one of its dependencies.
You can install `pamac-aur` if you want a **Graphical package manager**. 
:::

### Install Sddm

Due to the removal of drivers from the installed system, lightdm's webkit greeter crashes and fails to load the default theme.
Also, It's a bit slow on older machines. To fix this issue, Install `sddm` and `archcraft-sddm-theme-default`
```bash
$ sudo pacman -S sddm archcraft-sddm-theme-default
```

Copy sddm config file, Use **archcraft**  as the theme name
```bash
$ sudo cp /usr/lib/sddm/sddm.conf.d/default.conf /etc/sddm.conf.d/default.conf
``` 

Enable sddm service and reboot the computer
```bash
$ sudo systemctl enable -f sddm-plymouth.service
``` 

:::info
**All the issues above will be fixed ASAP and a new ISO will be uploaded soon.**
